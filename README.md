# Stream Replicator

[![Release][release-image]](releases)

## Overview

Application which can replicate an Amazon Kinesis stream to another Kinesis stream anywhere it might be deployed!  Currently this application is only available to run as an AWS Lambda function.

## Quick start

Assuming git is installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow-devops/stream-replicator
 host> cd stream-replicator
 host> make test
 host> make
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
 host> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
 host> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `make format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

### Publishing

This is handled through CI/CD on Github Actions. However all binaries will be generated by using the make command for local publishing and use.
