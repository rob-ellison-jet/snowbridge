# Stream Replicator

[![Release][release-image]][releases]

## Overview

Easily replicate data streams wherever you need them to be!  This application is available in three different runtimes to facilitate different needs - AWS Lambda, GCP CloudFunctions and as a standalone application.

See the [wiki documention](https://github.com/snowplow-devops/stream-replicator/wiki) for details on how to configure and run the application.

## Quick start

Assuming git is installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow-devops/stream-replicator
 host> cd stream-replicator
 host> make test
 host> make
```

All compiled assets are available under `build/compiled`.

To remove all build files:

```bash
 host> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
 host> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `make format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

### Publishing

This is handled through CI/CD on Github Actions. However all binaries will be generated by using the make command for local publishing and use.
